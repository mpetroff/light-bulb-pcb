# Lightbulb PCB

* Designed by [Matthew Petroff](https://mpetroff.net) in October 2017
* Designed for use with yellow soldermask
* Designed using [PCBmodE](https://github.com/boldport/pcbmode) 78e4a2303b199b248020c6e627bd6e8122334e3b

* Firmware based on [Adafruit NeoPixel Library example](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/blob/master/examples/strandtest/strandtest.ino) and licensed under GPLv3

## Mistakes

* ATtiny85 footprint is too narrow
* A wider TSL237T footprint would make hand soldering easier
* Copper pour for bulb background would look nicer
